;; Zsh completion system with Anything interface.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put the anything-zsh-screen.el to your load-path.
;; Put the anything-zsh-screen.zsh (the helper zsh script file) to the
;; location poited by `anything-zsh-screen-script-file-name'.
;; (defualt: ~/.emacs.d)
;;
;; Start a screen session named by `anything-zsh-screen-session-name' and
;; within that session, run the start up commands.
;; Like below.
;; % screen -S anything-zsh-screen
;; % source ~/.emacs.d/anything-zsh-screen.zsh
;; % anything-zsh-screen-rc
;; (You can now detach this screen session.)
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;; (eval-after-load
;;  'shell
;;  '(define-key shell-mode-map "\e\t" 'anything-zsh-screen-simple-complete))

;;; Note:
;;
;; This package requires several working executables listed below,
;; Zsh and screen.
